## ByteZone Injector
ByteZone Injector is a user-mode injector designed for educational purposes in computer science. It allows you to explore injection techniques and gain insights into how applications interact with the system at a deep level.
- Multiple Injection Methods
ByteZone Injector offers various injection techniques to experiment with, providing a hands-on learning experience for understanding application loading and execution mechanisms. 

- Current Features
Native Injection: 
This version of ByteZone Injector currently supports native injection using LoadLibraryA, providing a solid foundation for understanding injection mechanisms.

- Clean and Commented Code
 The codebase is well-structured with clear comments, making it easy to understand and learn from.

- Work in Progress
Multiple Injection Methods:
Development is ongoing to integrate additional injection techniques, including:
Kernel injection using IOCTL with a custom driver (driver under development)
Manual mapping (planned for future release)
Thread hijacking (planned for future release)

- NOTE
Kernel injection, manual mapping, and thread hijacking features are not yet available in this version.
