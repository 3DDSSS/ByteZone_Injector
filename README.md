## ByteZone Injector
ByteZone Injector is a user-mode injector designed for educational purposes in computer science. It allows you to explore injection techniques and gain insights into how applications interact with the system at a deep level.
### Multiple Injection Methods
ByteZone Injector offers various injection techniques to experiment with, providing a hands-on learning experience for understanding application loading and execution mechanisms. 

### Current Features
**Native Injection:**
This version of ByteZone Injector currently supports native injection using LoadLibraryA, providing a solid foundation for understanding injection mechanisms.

### Clean and Well-Commented Code
The codebase is well-structured and includes clear comments, making it easy to learn from and understand as you experiment with the current Native Injection feature.

### Roadmap
**Development is ongoing to integrate additional injection techniques, including:**
1. Kernel injection using IOCTL with a custom driver (driver under development)
2. Manual mapping (planned for future release)
3. Thread hijacking (planned for future release)

### NOTE
Kernel injection, manual mapping, and thread hijacking features are not yet available in this version.
